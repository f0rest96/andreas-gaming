# Information about the site

**Community start**

Community starte as few friends that love to play games, especially GTA San Andreas Multiplayer, and hang around shooting shit.
Friend started working on the script for the server using `pawno` scripting language based on `lua`.
After picking up a little experience in the domain of coding, he was able to make a really good Roleplay (RP) server for us to play in 2012.
After that community exploded and alot of people started playing on our server and with us.

**Community today**

Today after all this years, there are people still playing and enjoing our server. But as all good servers ,they need a dedicated website. 
So here is the part where i step in.

# About the code

## Starting with `HTML` & `CSS`
I firstly started and played around with HTML and CSS, but as i wanted to do something with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) i quickly implemented that into my design.
I ‚ù§ HTML and CSS and doing all the laibor by hand but, Bootstrap just kinda gives me a workaround to do things quickly.

## Adding `PHP` to the mix.
Well as i was working the site, i wanted to make it a little more dynamic, so hence `PHP`. 
But there is one thing to note here. **I never touched PHP in my life** üëÄ sooooo.
A few days later and multiple tutorials and documentation,there it is, i managed to learn basic PHP and implement it into my site.
I added:
- Dynamic Header and footer
- Contact form using `mail()`
- A little timer in the footer using `JS`
- And a few more things

###End
All and all , i learned alot with this project and i hope you like it.
Here is the [Site](#)
